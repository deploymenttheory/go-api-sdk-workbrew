# Workbrew API Acceptance Test Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values
# DO NOT commit the .env file with real credentials!

# =============================================================================
# Required Configuration
# =============================================================================

# Your Workbrew API key (required)
# Get this from: https://console.workbrew.com/settings/api
WORKBREW_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Your Workbrew workspace name (required)
# This is the workspace identifier shown in the console URL
# Example: https://console.workbrew.com/workspaces/YOUR-WORKSPACE-NAME
WORKBREW_WORKSPACE_NAME=your-workspace-name

# =============================================================================
# Optional Configuration
# =============================================================================

# Base URL for Workbrew API (default: https://console.workbrew.com)
# Only change this if using a different Workbrew instance
# WORKBREW_BASE_URL=https://console.workbrew.com

# Delay between test executions to respect API rate limits (default: 2s)
# Increase this if you encounter rate limiting errors
# WORKBREW_RATE_LIMIT_DELAY=2s

# Request timeout for API calls (default: 30s)
# Increase this for slower network connections or large responses
# WORKBREW_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=30s

# Skip cleanup operations after tests (default: false)
# Set to true to leave test resources for inspection
# WARNING: May leave test data in your workspace
# WORKBREW_SKIP_CLEANUP=false

# Enable verbose logging for debugging (default: false)
# Shows detailed test execution information
# WORKBREW_VERBOSE=false

# =============================================================================
# Known Test Data (Optional)
# =============================================================================
# Configure these if you have specific test resources in your workspace
# If not set, tests will use data discovered from API responses

# Known device serial number for device-specific tests
# WORKBREW_TEST_DEVICE_SERIAL=ABC123DEF456

# Known device group name for group-specific tests
# WORKBREW_TEST_GROUP_NAME=Engineering

# Known brewfile name for brewfile tests
# WORKBREW_TEST_BREWFILE_NAME=default

# Known cask name for cask tests (default: docker)
# WORKBREW_TEST_CASK_NAME=docker

# Known formula name for formula tests (default: git)
# WORKBREW_TEST_FORMULA_NAME=git

# Known event ID for event-specific tests
# WORKBREW_TEST_EVENT_ID=evt_1234567890

# Known CVE ID for vulnerability tests
# WORKBREW_TEST_CVE=CVE-2023-12345

# =============================================================================
# Usage Examples
# =============================================================================
#
# Run all acceptance tests:
#   make test-acceptance
#
# Run tests with verbose output:
#   WORKBREW_VERBOSE=true make test-acceptance
#
# Run specific service tests:
#   go test -v ./workbrew/acceptance/ -run TestAcceptance_Devices
#
# Run tests without cleanup (for debugging):
#   WORKBREW_SKIP_CLEANUP=true go test -v ./workbrew/acceptance/
#
# =============================================================================
# Important Notes
# =============================================================================
#
# 1. Use a dedicated TEST workspace, not production!
# 2. Acceptance tests make real API calls and count against your rate limits
# 3. Some tests create temporary resources (brewfiles, commands)
# 4. Always review cleanup behavior before running against important data
# 5. Set WORKBREW_SKIP_CLEANUP=false (default) to ensure cleanup runs
#
